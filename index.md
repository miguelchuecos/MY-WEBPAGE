    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. 
      HTML is not a programming language, which means that it does not have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similar to Microsoft Word.</p> <br>
 <p>However, throughout its different versions, various features have been incorporated and removed, in order to make it more efficient and facilitate the development of web pages compatible with different browsers and platforms (desktop PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets , etc.) However, to correctly interpret a new version of HTML, web browser developers must incorporate these changes and the user must be able to use the new version of the browser with the changes incorporated. Normally the changes are applied through automatic update patches (Firefox, Chrome) or by offering a new version of the browser with all the changes incorporated, on an official download website (Internet Explorer). Therefore, an outdated browser will not be able to correctly interpret a web page written in a higher version of HTML than it can interpret, which often forces developers to apply techniques and changes that allow correcting display problems and even interpretation of HTML code. Likewise, pages written in a previous version of HTML should be updated or rewritten, which is not always the case. That is why certain browsers still maintain the ability to interpret web pages from previous HTML versions. For these reasons, there are still differences between different browsers and versions when interpreting the same web page.</p><br>
