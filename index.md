    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. 
      HTML is not a programming language, which means that it does not have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similar to Microsoft Word.</p>
