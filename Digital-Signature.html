	<h1> Digital Signature</h1>
	<p> The recognition of personal identity has evolved hand in hand with the technological growth of society. In the case of Spain, the <strong>DNI emerged in 1951</strong>, gradually expanding the mandatory nature of its use until it reached those over 14 years of age.
Currently, the <strong>National Identity Document or DNI</strong> serves much more than confirming our data in person in front of the authorities and administrations. This is thanks to the incorporation of measures such as the <em>electronic signature</em>.</p>
    <h2> What is the electronic DNI?</h2>
	<p> The electronic DNI is a personal identification document issued by the Government of Spain. This represents a further step in the development of electronic administration in the country. The electronic DNI consists mainly of:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>A chip with the personal data of its owner.</li>
		<li>Certificates for authentication and electronic signature.</li>
	</ul>
