	<h1> Internet Security</h1>
		<h2> Difference between passive and active security threats </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Active attacks</li>
			<p>Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.<br>
				<li>Passive attacks</li>
				<p>Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.

		<h3> Malware </h3>
		<p> By definition, malware is an abbreviation of the words "malicious software", malicious software. This means that the software is designed and created to cause harm to a device or its user. It is a general term used to classify files or software that cause damage once they enter your system. This damage can manifest itself in many ways, often involving theft of data from the user's computer, encrypting that data, or simply deleting it. Malware also has the ability to change functions within the computer or take control of it entirely, as with botnets and rootkits.</p>  <br>
		<ul>
			<li> Worm</li>
			<p>A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behaviour will continue. Computer worms use recursive methods to copy themselves without host programs and distribute themselves based on the law of exponential growth, thus controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.</p><br>

			<br>
			<li> Trojan</li>
			<p> A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.</p> <br>

			<br>
			<li> Virus </li>
			<p> Virus are programs designed to infiltrate your computer and damage or alter your files and data. Viruses have the ability to corrupt or delete data on your computer. And like natural viruses, they also replicate. A computer virus is more dangerous than a computer worm, as it modifies or deletes your files, whereas worms only replicate without making changes to your files or data. Virus can infiltrate your computer as image attachments, greetings, or audio / video files. Another common entry point is Internet downloads. They can be hidden in free or trial programs, or in other downloaded files.Therefore, before downloading anything from the Internet, you must be sure what it is. Almost all viruses have an executable file attached to them, which means that viruses can be found on your computer but cannot affect you unless you open or run the malicious program. It should be noted that viruses cannot spread without human intervention, such as when we run an infected program.</p> <br>

			<li> Spyware </li>
			<p> Spyware is a type of malware that tries to stay hidden while secretly recording information and tracking your online activities, both on computers and mobile devices. You can monitor and copy everything you write, upload, download, and store. Some strains of spyware are also capable of activating cameras and microphones to see and hear you without your noticing.By definition, spyware is designed to be invisible, which can be one of its most damaging attributes - the longer it goes unnoticed, the more havoc it can wreak. It is like a virtual stalker who follows you through your use of the device, collecting your personal data at the same time.Strictly speaking, spyware has some valid uses. For example, your company might have a security policy that allows you to use software to monitor employee use of computers and mobile devices. The goal of corporate spyware is often to protect proprietary information or monitor employee productivity. Parental controls that limit device use and block adult content are also a form of spyware.You are most likely aware of any benign spyware you have installed on the device you are using. For the purposes of this article, we will focus on malicious spyware, that is, spyware that sneaks into your device with malicious intent.</p> <br>

			<h4>Software and hardware to protect networks</h4>
			<p> Network security is any practice or tool designed and implemented to secure a network and its data. It includes software, hardware, and cloud solutions. Effective network security tools stop a wide range of cyberattacks, and prevent attacks spreading throughout the network in case of a data breach.In today’s cyber environment, every organization must implement network security processes and solutions to maintain the uptime of their online resources. All network security solutions are implemented in accordance with the core principles of network security.Computer viruses and malware are everywhere. Antivirus programs such as Bitdefender, Panda Free Antivirus, Malwarebytes and Avast protect your computer against unauthorized code or software that may threaten your operating system. Viruses may have easy-to-spot effects – for example, they might slow your computer or delete key files – or they may be less conspicuous.Antivirus software plays a major role in protecting your system by detecting real-time threats to ensure your data is safe. Some advanced antivirus programs provide automatic updates, further protecting your machine from the new viruses that emerge every day. After you install an antivirus program, don't forget to use it. Run or schedule regular virus scans to keep your computer virus-free.<p>
			<h5> Network protocols: SSL, HTTPS, IPv6</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>SSL</li>
				<p>SSL is the acronym for Secure Sockets Layer, the standard technology for keeping an Internet connection secure, as well as for protecting any confidential information that is sent between two systems and preventing criminals from reading and modifying any data that is transferred, including information that could be considered personal. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and a browser) or from server to server (for example, an application with personally identifiable information or payroll data). This is done by ensuring that all data that is transferred between users and websites or between two systems is impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to encrypt the data that is transmitted and prevent hackers from reading it when sending it over the connection. This information could be any confidential or personal data, for example, credit card numbers and other bank details, names and addresses.</p><br>
				<li>HTTPS</li>
				<p>HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an Internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of user data between their computers and the website. As users expect their online experience to be secure and private, we recommend that you adopt HTTPS to protect their connections to your website, regardless of what it contains.Sending data using the HTTPS protocol is protected by the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which provides these three main layers of security:</p> 
				<ol>
					<li>Encryption: The exchanged data is encrypted to keep it safe from prying eyes. That means that when a user is browsing a website, no one can "eavesdrop" on their conversations, track their activities on different pages, or steal information from them.</li><br>
					<li>Data integrity: Data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfers, intentionally or otherwise, without detection.</li><br>
					<li>Authentication: it shows that your users are communicating with the intended website. It provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user confidence, which translates to other business benefits.</li><br>
				</ol>
				<li>IPv6</li>
				<p>The Internet works through IP addresses, and each device that connects to the Internet does so through these numerical addresses that work as license plates. Currently, the addresses that are used are those of Internet Protocol version 4 or IPv4, but there is a problem that the addresses that are generated with this protocol have run out. For this reason, on June 6, 2012, the IPv6 or Internet Protocol version 6 protocol was launched, which we had already heard about since 2008. It is a new way of creating IP addresses to be able to generate enough to support all the devices that are connected today and will be in the coming years.

IPv4s are 32-bit addresses, and this protocol allowed 4,294,967,296 addresses to be created, an obviously insufficient number today. On the other hand, the IPv6 protocol has a space of 128 bits, which makes it capable of holding 340 sextillion addresses, or what is the same, a total of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 IP addresses different.This also means that IPv6 addresses are much longer and more complex than IPv4. <br>
					
Those of the fourth version have an address structure of the style 255.255.255.255, while the new ones of the sixth version are of the style 2001: 0db8: 85a3: 08d3: 1319: 8a2e: 0370: 7332. As you can see, they are longer and have letters as well as numbers. <br>
					
According to Ericsson Research, in August 2019, IPv6 adoption barely exceeded 25%. Although the adoption rate has been achieved at the correct rate, it is estimated that by 2022 we will reach 28.3%, and that from that date everything will slow down even more, with a stagnation that will oscillate above that percentage.This means that the IPv6 protocol guarantees that we will have enough IP addresses to support the growth of connected devices in the coming years. There are still IPv4 addresses, since there are still resellers of these address packages that rehabilitate those that are no longer used. That is why possibly many of you still use them. Even so, IPv6 is the guarantee that we can continue to have free IPs in the future. <br>
				<h6> Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h6>
				<p>Certificate Authorities, or Certificate Authorities / CAs, issue Digital Certificates. Digital Certificates are verifiable small data files that contain identity credentials to help websites, people, and devices represent their authentic online identity (authentic because the CA has verified the identity). CAs play a critical role in how the Internet operates and how transparent, trusted transactions can take place online. CAs issue millions of Digital Certificates each year, and these certificates are used to protect information, encrypt billions of transactions, and enable secure communication.

An SSL Certificate is a popular type of Digital Certificate that binds the ownership details of a web server (and website) to cryptographic keys. These keys are used in the SSL/TLS protocol to activate a secure session between a browser and the web server hosting the SSL Certificate. In order for a browser to trust an SSL Certificate, and establish an SSL/TLS session without security warnings, the SSL Certificate must contain the domain name of website using it, be issued by a trusted CA, and not have expired.

According to analyst site Netcraft (www.netcraft.com), in August 2012 there are almost 2.5m SSL Certificates in use for public facing websites. In reality there are probably as many as 50% more than this number in use that cannot be identified by Netcraft on public facing websites. This makes SSL one of the most prevalent security technologies in use today.</p><br>
